<div><p>I used a data set acquired from https://warframe.market/, which is a site that manages trading in the PC video game Warframe.</p>

I set this up in order to inform prospective traders in the game, of what items may or may not be good investments to turn a profit in game. There are two scenes, following the interactive slideshow narrative hybrid structure. The first shows the price and number of sales of the items in the data set, in order to give some insight into what items are the most in demand, and what the supply looks like across the different types of items. The second scene is to look further into the types themselves, and how quickly the different categories sell, in order to show what items will turn faster profits. I did the scenes in this order to emphasize the categories with focusing on ( the ones that show at the most desired in scene one, also move the most stock in scene two.

The annotations are cleared by scene, as both rely on different views of the data.

The parameters are: page, which is whether the viewer is on scene on or scene two, via the controls at the bottom; zoom in scene 1 to control the data being displayed; categories in scene 2 to focus on the categories the viewer is interested in.

The triggers include: scene 1's zoom, move changes the scales and displayed data, scene 2's filters along the bottom to hide selected data, and what page/scene to go to.

The page controls are styled as buttons to make them more obvious, and the zoom/movement feature relies on convention to follow screen manipulation controls.

The data comes from https://warframe.market/, and I used two examples as references for the graphs:
